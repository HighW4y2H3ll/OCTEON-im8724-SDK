# This is a wrapper script around a perl program that actually does all
# the work.  This script is shell neutral, in that it will run on
# bash, csh, sh, and ksh shells.  As a result of this, there are severe
# constraints on what can be done directly.

# Check to see if the shell we are running uses 'setenv' or 'export' to 
# set variables.  If the shell uses setenv, then the variable is set with
# the value 2, otherwise stderr is redirected to /dev/null
setenv __OCTEON_SHELL_TEST__ 2>/dev/null

# Invoke the env-setup.pl script, which processes the arguments and constructs the correct
# environment changes for the shell that it was called from.
eval `./env-setup.pl  "$1" "$2" "$3" "$4" "$5" "$6" "$7"`

# Clean up test variable so that it is not left around to confuse subshells
unsetenv __OCTEON_SHELL_TEST__  2> /dev/null

# Return success (otherwise we return an error in bash)
echo -n ""
