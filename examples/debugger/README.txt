README for the Debugger Example

This example provides a trivial sample program for evaluating the debugger.

Running the Example
-------------------
$ make 
$ make run

Upon running the example a DDD debugger window will startup with two 
cores stopped at a breakpoint on main. From here you can issue debugger 
commands to evaluate variables and control program execution. Documentation
for the debugger is part of the Simple Executive under related pages.
