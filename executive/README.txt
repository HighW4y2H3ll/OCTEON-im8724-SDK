Readme for the OCTEON Executive Library


The OCTEON Executive Library provides runtime support and hardware 
abstraction for the OCTEON processor.  The executive is composed of the 
libcvmx.a library as well as header files that provide  
functionality with inline functions.


Usage:

The libcvmx.a library is built for every application as part of the
application build. (Please refer to the 'related pages' section of the 
HTML documentation for more information on the build system.)  
Applications using the executive should include the header files from
$OCTEON_ROOT/target/include and link against the library that is built in 
the local obj directory. Each file using the executive 
should include the following two header files in order:

#include "cvmx-config.h"
#include "cvmx.h"

The cvmx-config.h file contains configuration information for the 
executive and is generated by the cvmx-config script from an 
'executive-config.h' file. A sample version of this file is provided 
in the executive directory as 'executive-config.h.template'.  

Copy this file to 'executive-config.h' into the 'config' subdirectory 
of the application directory and customize as required by the application. 
Applications that don't use any simple executive functionality can omit 
the cvmx-config.h header file. Please refer to the examples for a 
demonstration of where to put the executive-config.h file and for an
example of generated cvmx-config.h.

For file specific information please see the documentation within the 
source files or the HTML documentation provided in docs/html/index.html.
The HTML documentation is automatically generated by Doxygen from the 
source files.
