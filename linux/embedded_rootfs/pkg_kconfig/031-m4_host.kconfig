		Build m4 for host target needed for building other packages.

		From the m4 homepage:

		GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor.
		It is mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some extensions (for example,
		handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros). GNU M4 also has
		built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing
		arithmetic, etc.
