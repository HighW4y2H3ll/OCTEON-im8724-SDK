		From the zlib homepage:
		zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally
		unencumbered -- that is, not covered by any patents -- lossless
		data-compression library for use on virtually any computer
		hardware and operating system. The zlib data format is itself
		portable across platforms. Unlike the LZW compression method
		used in Unix compress(1) and in the GIF image format, the
		compression method currently used in zlib essentially never
		expands the data. (LZW can double or triple the file size in
		extreme cases.) zlib's memory footprint is also independent of
		the input data and can be reduced, if necessary, at some cost
		in compression.
