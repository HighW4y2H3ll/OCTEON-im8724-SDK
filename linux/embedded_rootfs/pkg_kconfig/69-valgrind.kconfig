		From the valgrind homepage:
		Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic
		analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect
		many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs 
		in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

		The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality
		tools: a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache
		and branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and
		branch-prediction profiler, and a heap profiler.
