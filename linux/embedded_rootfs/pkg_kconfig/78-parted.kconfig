		From the parted homepage:
		GNU Parted manipulates partition tables. This is useful for creating space
		for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, copying data on hard
		disks and disk imaging. The package contains a library, libparted, as well
		as well as a command-line frontend, parted, which can also be used in scripts.
