htlbremap is a shared library that you can use to remap the
application (text, data and heap) into huge TLB pages.  This will
significantly reduce the number of pages used by the application and
thus the number of TLB refills needed.

For further details please refer to the Linux Userspace on Octeon
section in the SDK documentation.
