This library wraps pthread locking functions to collect statistics.
This includes for example how many cycles the application spent
acquiring or releasing a lock or how long it held the lock.

The library can be actived using the LD_PRELOAD mechanism.  Because of
this there is no need to rebuild the application in order to gather
statistics for it.  The statistics are printed after the program
exits.

Currently spinlocks, mutexes and condition variables are traced.

There is some overhead in collecting these statistics.  For each call
the statistic for the lock needs to be looked up in a hash table.  If
you are only interested tracking one particular lock you can set the
appropriate environment varible LOCKSTAT_FILTER_COND,
LOCKSTAT_FILTER_MUTEX or LOCKSTAT_FILTER_SPINLOCK to the address of
the lock.  The same variables can also be used to disable tracking of
a whole category.  You can do this by setting the appropriate variable
to empty (null address).

This is an example of how to use the library.  lockstat-test is just a
simple test app exercising one instance of each lock type.  Things
prefixed with "lockstat: " are printed by the library upon exit.  Each
lock identified with its address and the duration of relevant
operations is printed in cycles, first in total then on a per-thread basis.
