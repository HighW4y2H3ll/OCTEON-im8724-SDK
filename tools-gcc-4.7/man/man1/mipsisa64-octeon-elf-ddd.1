.\"
\s-1DDD\s+1 is a graphical front-end for \s-1GDB\s+1 and other
command-line debuggers.  Using DDD, you can see what is going on
\*(lqinside\*(rq another program while it executes\(em\&or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.
.PP
\s-1DDD\s+1 can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
.IP \(bu 2
Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
behavior.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Make your program stop on specified conditions.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
.PP
\*(lqClassical\*(rq \s-1UNIX\s+1 debuggers such as the \s-1GNU\s+1
debugger (\s-1GDB\s+1) provide a command-line interface and a
multitude of commands for these and other debugging purposes.
\s-1DDD\s+1 is a comfortable \fIgraphical user interface\fR around
an inferior \s-1GDB\s+1, \s-1DBX\s+1, Ladebug, \s-1XDB\s+1,
\s-1JDB\s+1, Python debugger, or Perl debugger.
.PP
\s-1DDD\s+1 is invoked with the shell command \fBddd\fR.  You can
open a program to be debugged using `\fBFile\(->Open Program\fR' (the
`\fBOpen Program\fR' item in the `\fBFile\fR' menu.  You can get
online help at any time using the `\fBHelp\fR' menu; for the first
steps, try `\fBHelp\(->What Now?\fR'.  Quit \s-1DDD\s+1 using
`\fBFile\(->Exit\fR'.
.PP
More information on \s-1DDD\s+1 is contained in the \s-1DDD\s+1
Manual.  You can read the text-only version in \s-1DDD\s+1 (via
`\fBHelp\(->DDD Reference\fR') or in Emacs (as Info file).
Full-fledged HTML, PostScript, and PDF versions are available online
via the \s-1DDD\s+1 WWW page,

.SH "OPTIONS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
These are the most important options used when starting \s-1DDD\s+1.
All options may be abbreviated, as long as they are unambiguous;
single dashes may also be used.  \s-1DDD\s+1 also understands the
usual X options such as `\fB\-display\fR' or `\fB\-geometry\fR'; see
\fBX(1)\fR for details.
.PP
All arguments and options not handled by \s-1DDD\s+1 are passed to
the inferior debugger.  To pass an option to the inferior debugger
that conflicts with an X option, or with a \s-1DDD\s+1 option listed
here, use the `\fB\-\-debugger\fR' option, below.
.PP
.\"
.TP
.B \-\-configuration
Show the \s-1DDD\s+1 configuration settings and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-dbx
Run the \s-1DBX\s+1 debugger as inferior debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-debugger \fIname\fR
Invoke the inferior debugger \fIname\fR.  This is useful if you have
several debugger versions around, or if the inferior debugger cannot
be invoked as `\fBgdb\fR', `\fBdbx\fR', `\fBxdb\fR', `\fBjdb\fR',
`\fBpydb\fR', or `\fBperl\fR' respectively.
.br
This option can also be used to pass options to the inferior debugger
that would otherwise conflict with \s-1DDD\s+1 options.  For
instance, to pass the option `\fB\-d \fIdirectory\fR' to \s-1XDB\s+1,
use:
.sp
.br
  \fBddd\ \-\-debugger "xdb \-d \fIdirectory\fB"\fR
.br
.sp
If you use the `\fB\-\-debugger\fR' option, be sure that the type of
inferior debugger is specified as well.  That is, use one of the
options `\fB\-\-gdb\fR', `\fB\-\-dbx\fR', `\fB\-\-xdb\fR',
`\fB\-\-jdb\fR'\, `\fB\-\-pydb\fR', or `\fB\-\-perl\fR' (unless the
default setting works fine).
.TP
.B \-\-gdb
Run the \s-1GDB\s+1 debugger as inferior debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Give a list of frequently used options.  Show options of the
inferior debugger as well.
.TP
.B \-\-host \fR[\|\fIusername\fB@\fR\|]\|\fIhostname\fR
Invoke the inferior debugger directly on the remote host
\fIhostname\fR.  If \fIusername\fR is given and the `\fB\-\-login\fR'
option is not used, use \fIusername\fR as remote user name.
.TP
.B \-\-jdb
Run \s-1JDB\s+1 as inferior debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-ladebug
Run Ladebug as inferior debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-perl
Run Perl as inferior debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-pydb
Run \s-1PYDB\s+1 as inferior debugger.
.TP 
.B \-\-rhost \fR[\|\fIusername\fB@\fR\|]\|\fIhostname\fR
Run the inferior debugger interactively on the remote host
\fIhostname\fR.  If \fIusername\fR is given and the `\fB\-\-login\fR'
option is not used, use \fIusername\fR as remote user name.
.TP
.B \-\-trace
Show the interaction between \s-1DDD\s+1 and the inferior debugger
on standard error.  This is useful for debugging \s-1DDD\s+1.  If
`\fB\-\-trace\fR' is not specified, this information is written into
`\fB$HOME/.ddd/log\fR', such that you can also do a post-mortem
debugging.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show the \s-1DDD\s+1 version and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-wdb
Run the \s-1WDB\s+1 debugger as inferior debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-xdb
Run \s-1XDB\s+1 as inferior debugger.
.PP
A full list of options, including important options of the inferior
debugger, can be found in the \s-1DDD\s+1 manual.
