DDD-3.3.11
==========

* New features and minor improvements
- A bug in DBX mode introduced in release 3.3.10 has been fixed.
- A bug which prevented DDD from properly displaying ISO-8859-1 characters
  (and probably other character sets too) under Motif has been fixed (1)
(1) Thanks to Ted Creedon for his patch.

DDD-3.3.10
==========

* New features and minor improvements
- More fixes for perl 5.8.x -- it's now a lot more usable.
- Fixes for Sun's SunONE Studio dbx (1). Build with -DHAVE_SUNDBX is
  necessary. Improvements for automatic detection of Sun DBX are welcome.
- Fixes for MacOS X (mainly workarounds for bugs in gdb) (2).

* Build fixes
- automake 1.9 is now the minimum requirement. This affects only builds
  from CVS repository.
- A warning is emitted if a version of g++ older than 3.1 is used.
- libiberty is neither linked nor bundled anymore.
- GNU libtermcap is not bundled anymore. A termcap like library (such as
  ncurses) is now required to build ddd.
  configure has '--with-termlib=LIB' and '--with-termlib-libraries=DIR'
  to offer a finer control on the choice of library.

(1) Thanks to Ingo Dahm for this patch.
(2) Thanks to Terry Teague.

DDD-3.3.9
=========

* New features and minor improvements
- Support for PHP debugger has been added (1).  This is essentially not
  tested.
- Source files in subdirectories should be located automatically
  when using dbx (tested on Solaris' dbx) (2).
- The perl version supported by DDD is now 5.8.x.  The perl debugger
  changed between perl 5.6.x and perl 5.8.0, which made this update necessary.
  This change is not backwards-compatible.  If it is not possible to upgrade
  your perl version to 5.8.x or newer, then you can simply install the file
  "perl5db.pl" from a recent perl distribution into your old perl tree.
- Through the maintenance menu ("ddd --maintenance"), it now possible to get
  a leak check of ddd if ddd is run under valgrind. This is only useful for
  ddd developers (or anybody that wants to help making ddd better).
- Several minor bugs fixed, some memory leaks plugged, more code clean-up
  done.
- A bug affecting platforms where the size of function pointers is 16 has
  been fixed.
- The settings window now starts at a larger, more reasonable size, and
  allows the user to resize it.

* Build fixes
- The configure machinery has been updated to conform more closely to the
  autoconf 2.5x requirements. Several bugs have been fixed.
  Minimum requirements: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.
- libiberty (which provides missing standard functions) is not linked by
  default anymore. configure has a new option '--with-libiberty' that
  enables the libiberty support if required.
  If nobody complains, libiberty will be unbundled in a next version.
- The libiberty distributed with ddd has been upgraded to the one included
  in GCC 3.4 20040116. It fixes some configuration problems.
- Builds with GCC 3.4, with IBM xlC on AIX, with Compaq/HP cxx on Tru64,
  on X11R5 based systems, with SGI CC on IRIX should be OK.
- Builds on HP-UX should now work out-of-the-box. Motif is linked statically
  and the Athena libraries are now found by default.
- Builds without Motif/Lesstif available abort with an adequate message.
- Builds with readline support now work. readline is not bundled anymore.
- Builds without -DNDEBUG (i.e. with "assert" enabled) now work.
  Default build enables assertions (i.e. -DNDEBUG is not used).
- Several missing files in the distribution are now included.
- Cygwin is supported again.

DDD-3.3.8
=========

- The settings, signals, themes, and status-display windows are now resizable
  (if your window-manager can resize transient dialog windows).
- The settings are now read correctly when using gdb 5.x and 6.0.
- A memory corruption has been fixed in strclass.h.
- Several other memory management problems have been fixed.
- configure options --enable-builtin-app-defaults and --enable-builtin-vsllib
  should work again.
- Speed improvements, partly by avoiding the creation of temporary objects.
- Bug fixes in perl mode (1).
- Builds on HPUX-10.20 now work OK (see the PROBLEMS file).
- The libiberty distributed with ddd has been upgraded to the one released
  with gcc-3.3.1.  This helps DDD to build on NetBSD.

(1) Thanks to Christian Hattemer and Peter Ernst.

DDD-3.3.7
=========

- libiberty was missing from the 3.3.6 release
- libtermcap was built but not linked on systems which needed it
  (suse-axp-linux 8.1; probably others too)

DDD-3.3.6
=========

- Andreas Zeller handed the role of maintainter to
  Andrew Gaylard <apg@users.sf.net>
- The source tree was merged back from the bashdb project's CVS into the
  original ddd CVS

DDD 3.3.3-3.3.5
===============

- Major changes to get this to compile with modern auto-tools, Bison,
  Flex, and C++ STL. (1)

- Support for Bash debugging. (2)

- Several memory leaks have been fixed. Less temporaries are generated (3).

  This fork of the code put together by Daniel Schepler
  <schepler@math.berkeley.edu> and Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

DDD 3.3.2
=========

DDD 3.3.2 brings a few usage improvements and minor bug fixes:

- Options are automatically saved when exiting DDD.
- Temporary sessions in Gnome and KDE are now properly deleted.
- The Tip of the Day comes with an option to turn it off.
- Alias detection is now on by default.
- The splash screen no longer bypasses all window controls.
- Major code clean-up, including plugging several memory leaks (1).
- GCC 3.0 should properly compile DDD.
- ChangeLog files are back.

(1) Thanks to Arnaud Desitter <arnaud.desitter@nag.co.uk>!

- The option to create new displays `left-to-right' is restored upon startup.
- Fortran struct members are accessed as `A%B' instead of `A.B'.
- Certain structure changes in plotted displays no longer crash DDD.
- You can specify the top-level geometry via `-geometry'.
- The `pydb' debugger has been fixed to work with recent Python releases.
- Ornamented Perl debugger prompts are handled correctly.
- DDD honors the TMPDIR environment variable for creating temporary files.
- The `configure' script identifies recent hardware configurations.
- Minor compilation problems with GCC 2.7.2 have been fixed.
- Minor compilation problems with GCC 3.0 (prerelease) have been fixed.
- Minor compilation problems with Sun CC have been fixed.
- Minor potential problems with 64 bit pointers have been fixed.



DDD 3.3
=======

DDD 3.3 brings data themes, debugger interaction while the program is
running, support for JDB 1.2, and several bug fixes.


Data Themes
-----------

- DDD supports _data themes_ - modifiers that change the appearance of 
  program data.  Try `Data->Themes'.

- Data themes included with this release are:
  * Show specific expressions in a smaller font (useful for arrays).
  * Show display titles in a smaller font.
  * Suppress specific structure members or expressions.

- New data themes can be defined by users and installed at run-time.

- More themes are in preparation, such as rendering of C++ STL data structures.


Debuggers and Languages
-----------------------

- JDB as of JDK 1.2 is supported.

- GDB 5.0 is supported.

- You can use `ddd --wdb' to have DDD startup with WDB.  

- When choosing a debugger automatically, DDD will try `wdb' if `gdb'
  is not available.

- WindRiver's version of GDB (within the Tornado/vxworks environment)
  is supported.  See the DDD Reference, Section `WindRiver GDB' for
  details. (5)

- SGI DBX, Sun DBX, other DBXes as well as Compaq Ladebug can now
  attach to processes via DDD. (1)

- Parsing of GDB breakpoint information has been improved. (2)

- Parsing of Perl breakpoint information has been improved.

- Perl hash keys containing spaces are supported. (8)

- Using the separate execution window now improves parsing debugger
  output.  See the DDD documentation for the new `bufferGDBOutput'
  resource.


Examining Data
--------------

- New displays can be created left-to-right.  
  See `Edit => Preferences => Data => Placement'.  (6)

- Handling of Ladebug array output has been improved.  (7)

- Handling of multiple C++ base classes has been improved.

- Names that are keywords in some programming languages (such as
  `interface', `object', `class') should no longer impose problems when
  occurring in programs of other languages.

- Several memory leaks have been plugged. (1)


User Interface
--------------

- The default DDD font has been changed from `helvetica-bold' to
  `helvetica-medium', thus integrating better into KDE and GNOME
  environments.

- You can interact with the debugger while the program is running;
  DDD automatically interrupts and resumes debuggee execution.  See the
  `stopAndContinue' resource for details.

- Undo and Redo now apply on logical groups of commands.  If an action
  caused multiple commands, Undo will undo them with one click.

- Interrupts (Ctrl+C) from the controlling TTY can be issued multiple times.

- With LessTif, the source window no longer scrolls around when
  setting or deleting breakpoints.

- With LessTif, combo boxes (drop-down text boxes) no longer shrink.

- With LessTif, Text selection works better.

- With LessTif, typing in the debugger console works better.

- With LessTif, switching the register set works.

- Drag and Drop of breakpoints in the machine code is supported.

- Names of debuggee files and directories may contain spaces.

- Spin boxes (used to step values) have been slightly improved.

- Forwarding of keyboard events from the source window into the
  debugger console is now optional.  See the `consoleHasFocus' resource. (10)


Printing
--------

- PostScript printing includes background colors (e.g. changed values)



Installation
------------

- PLEASE NOTE: Several installation details have changed.  Be sure to
  read the `INSTALL' file for new installation instructions.

- Several DDD resources (such as the application defaults) now reside
  in separate files, reducing DDD executable size and memory footprint 
  by about 300k.

- To run DDD from the build directory (i.e. before installing), you
  must set the DDD_HOME and XUSERFILESEARCH environment variables.
  See the `INSTALL' file for details.

- The configure `--enable-rpath' option allows you to specify a path
  to be searched for dynamic libraries at run-time.

- DDD Makefiles are now GNU standards-compliant and generated by automake.

- DDD Makefiles use libtool for generic shared library support.

- A bad dependency on $(SHELL) in the Makefile has been fixed.  This
  caused unnecessary calls of flex and bison in the distribution. (9)

- A bad wildcard use in the Makefile has been fixed. (3)

- A compilation problem in `PannedGE.C' with some GCC variants has been fixed.

- DDD now compiles cleanly even with `gcc -Wwrite-strings'.  This
  avoids several warnings/errors on C++ compilers other than GCC. (1)

- The `--configuration' option now gives more information about the
  compiler being used to compile DDD. (1)

- ddd.texi rules in the Makefile have been fixed. (4)

- The release includes the `libiberty' and `readline' packages as of GDB 5.0.


License
-------

- All remaining parts of DDD that used the GNU Library Public General
  License (LGPL) have been changed to use the GNU General Public 
  License (GPL) instead.

- The DDD Manual is released under the new GNU Free Documentation License.


Tracking Code Changes
---------------------

- This release no longer includes `ChangeLog' files.  Instead, you can
  directly access old and recent DDD versions (including a list of all
  changes) via the public CVS interface at

      http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/

- You can also download most recent DDD versions from the public CVS
  interface.  See the file `README-CVS' in the CVS archive for details.

DDD 3.2
=======

DDD 3.2 brings a new documentation and several minor improvements.


DDD is now a GNU program
------------------------

- Starting with this release, DDD is an official GNU program,
  distributed by the Free Software Foundation.  This brings a number of
  administrative changes:

  * DDD is distributed as source only using GNU FTP sites and mirrors.
  
  * The DDD WWW page is now `http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/'.
  
  * The DDD mailing addresses are now `bug-ddd@gnu.org' (for bug reports) 
    and `ddd@gnu.org' (for announcements, discussions, or anything else).
  
    You can subscribe to these lists by sending an e-mail to
    `bug-ddd-request@gnu.org' and `ddd-request@gnu.org', respectively.

  The old mailing list addresses are now just aliases for the new ones.


Documentation
-------------

- There is a new DDD manual, generated from Texinfo source, and coming
  in HTML, PDF, PostScript, Info, as well as plain text format.


Debuggers and Languages
-----------------------

- This release contains partial support for the Compaq/DEC `Ladebug' debugger.
  Please send in bug reports listing remaining problems.

- Parsing of JDB data has been improved.

- DBX prompts for object file names are recognized.


User Interface
--------------

- `Breakpoint Properties', `Define Command', and `Debugger Settings'
  have an `Apply' button that applies changes to text fields.

- In TTY mode, you can edit and complete the command line as in GDB.
  (Uses GNU readline library.)

- Ctrl+E moves the cursor to the end of the line.  For a `Run'
  shortcut, use F2/F3 or Shift+Ctrl+E.

- DDD uses the locale as specified by the environment (such as $LANG).
  This allows input of locale characters in DDD dialogs; error
  messages may also come up in your locale.  If you experience any
  problems, set LANG=C when invoking DDD.


Plotting
--------

- If you have several indexed variables in a cluster (such as X[1],
  X[3], and X[5]), DDD plots the cluster as 2-D plot, where the X axis
  shows the index, and the Y axis shows the values.  This is useful for
  plotting array slices (see below).


Source Navigation
-----------------

- Using GDB, `Open Source' no longer automatically reads all shared
  libraries of the debuggee; this took too much time with some programs.
  There is an additional button that loads libraries.


Data exploration
----------------

- You can rotate structs, saving space by omitting the member names.
  A rotated struct looks very much like a horizontal array.

- The last rotation setting is used for new displays and is saved
  together with other DDD options.

- Array slices `ARRAY[FROM..TO]' are much better supported:
  * By default, the displayed values are clustered and displayed like an 
    ordinary array.
  * Array slices can be plotted, too (see `Plotting', above).

- You can use the FROM..TO notation in arbitrary values, and also multiple
  times; `graph display 1..5 * 1..5' creates a multiplication table.

- To select multiple displays, it suffices that the selection rectangle
  touches a display (rather than enclosing it entirely).

- The Display Editor has buttons for clustering and unclustering displays.


Running the Program
-------------------

- Breakpoint commands are also supported for DBX, Perl, and XDB.

- In Perl, DDD supports temporary breakpoints.


Settings
--------

- DDD saves the GDB source directory path with the current session.

- DDD saves the JDB class path only with the current session.

DDD 3.2 also incorporates all improvements and bug fixes from earlier releases.
